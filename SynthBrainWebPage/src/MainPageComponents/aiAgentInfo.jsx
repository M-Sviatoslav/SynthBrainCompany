        What is an AI Agent? An AI Agent is a digital assistant powered by
        artificial intelligence that can understand tasks, make decisions, and
        take action without constant human input. Unlike traditional software
        that only follows strict rules, an AI Agent learns, adapts, and works
        intelligently to achieve specific goals.

        chat, email or voice, and deliver highly personalized experiences for
        both customers and employees.
